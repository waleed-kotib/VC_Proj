	  The Coccinella : Jabber application with Whiteboard
	  ---------------------------------------------------

		version 0.94.5, 30th August, 2003

		       by: Mats Bengtsson



What is this?

    This is a  Jabber  client which has a  complete system  for instant 
    messages, chat, groupchat etc. But more importantly, it extends the
    Jabber instant messages system to a kind of whiteboard system. Just
    like ordinary text messages,  you may send complete  whiteboards to 
    other users, share a whiteboard in a one-to-one chat, or groupchat.

    	Perhaps it is  better to describe it  using the  desktop  metaphor.
    Just like your computer has a desktop with files, symbols  and windows,
    this whiteboard is  similar, but  instead of using  files  and folders,
    it actually  shows the  contents of these files.  That is, for an image
    file we show the actual image, an mp3 is shown as a minimal player etc.
    This should work in a modular way using a plugin architecture; a plugin
    is responsible for a set of MIME types, how they should be displayed in
    the whiteboard, user interactions, any playback or whatever is relevant.
    And most importantly, these items are shared with other users in a form
    that  depends on the  type,  such as single  message (like an email), 
    one-to-one chat, or groupchat.

The Jabber system:

    The Coccinella can be configured into two main modes.  The services
    supported by these two modes are very different.  You switch between 
    these two modes using the Preferences/Preferences...  menu, and the
    "General/Network Setup" panel.
    	The recommended way of running this application is the Jabber way.

    * Jabber Server: The Jabber Instant Messaging system is an XML based 
      system that works similar to ICQ, AIM etc.  It delivers messages 
      seamlessly between many instant messaging system and Jabber clients.  
      This application is a Jabber client, but it is not a normal Jabber 
      client since it delivers much more than just text messages.  Visit 
      "www.jabber.org" or "www.jabberstudio.org" for more information, 
      and to obtain your own server.

      To get started with a Jabber server, register an account (if you 
      haven't already) using the Jabber/New Account...  menu, and fill in 
      the fields.  When you later log on, you do it from the Jabber/Login...
      menu, and pick the server you have an account at. Or just use the
      Setup Assistant menu command.

    * Peer-to-peer: This is the "raw" configuration, where users connect 
      directly to each other, and not via an external server.  This mode 
      does not deliver the kind of user administration that is supplied by 
      the Jabber system, such as contact lists, online/offline, offline 
      delivery etc. It is therefore not recommended to use.

Installation:

    * Starting with version 0.94.5, no installation whatsoever is needed.
      Just unzip and double click.

    It is necessary to have access to a unique server port on remote 
    machines, so it can be problematic if you are behind a firewall.  
    Firewalls are not dealt with at all at this stage.

Testing:

    It is to be considered as a developer release, so beware.  *It is far 
    from being bug free*.  It has been tested on MacOS 9.2, Mac OS X 10.2, 
    Red Hat Linux 8.0, and Windows 2000. It requires a Tcl version 8.4 or 
    later.

    I would judge this as an alpha quality application, not beta, which is 
    reflected in the version number ( < 1.0). No instabilities are known, 
    however.

Additional Notes:
    
    * Jabber: if you run this as a Jabber client, then be sure that the
      servers's "karma", which controls maximal throughput, is set high.  
      This client delivers more data than an ordinary Jabber client, and 
      data may "get stuck" in the server if karma is too low.

Documentation:

    The source code is the only documentation. At least so far ;-)
    See also the Info/Help menu.

Non-latin character sets:

    On Macintosh with a "Chinese Language Kit" it is possible to write 
    chinese, at least does it look as chinese to me.  But you need to import
    the correct font from the Preference menu.  Be sure that all connected 
    remote clients also have this font on their system; I don't think it 
    needs to be imported. Probably any "Language Kit" should work.

Known Bugs:

    * Althogh the server is using a safe interpreter for the critical parts
      of canvas drawings which uses the dangerous eval, it probably does not 
      cover all possible attacks from an evil client.

    * If large items are transported between clients, such as images, or
      movies, operations on these items before they have been completely 
      received by remote clients are lost.

    * It may sometimes happen that the internal settings become confused 
      which results in a corrupt preference file. If you suspect this then
      delete this file:
          Unix/Linux       ~/.coccinella/whiteboard
	  Windows          Coccinella/WBPREFS.TXT     (search for it)
	  Mac OS 8/9       :Program Preferences:Coccinella:Whiteboard Prefs
	  Mac OS X         ~/Library/Preferences/Whiteboard Prefs

    * Printer support is still in its infacy. You may export the canvas to
      XML/SVG format which can be imported into a web browser using the free
      plugin from www.adobe.com, and print from inside your browser.

    * There are numerous "details" that need to be fixed. After all, it is an 
      alpha quality software!

    As always, the code needs cleaning and restructuring.  If you want to see
    what is happening "inside" you may set the various debug variables equal to
    2 or larger.  There are two in Coccinella.tcl, one in Jabber.tcl,
    jabberlib.tcl, and wrapper.tcl respectively. They may also be specified
    at the command line as:

    set argv "-debugLevel 3 -debugServerLevel 3 -jstate_debug 2"
    set argc 6

    and launch it. You need to have the source distribution and a Tcl/Tk
    installation to do this, or pick the Jabber/Debug menu, and do:

    set debugLevel 3
    set debugServerLevel 3
    set ::Jabber::jstate(debug) 3

Home:

    The present home of the Coccinella is at
    "http://hem.fyristorg.com/matben", where links to the extensions also 
    can be found. Starting with release 0.94.3 the code is put on 
    SourceForge's cvs, where you may get snapshots of developer code.
    Look at "http://coccinella.sourceforge.net" which is the official
    developer home.

The Beetle:

    Don't be afraid for the 'Coccinella' (ladybug), it's tame!

    * Raymond Tang: resolving links, adding ImageMagick support, local
      incoming dir...
