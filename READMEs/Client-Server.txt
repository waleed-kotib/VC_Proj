HOWTO: Client-Server configuration
----------------------------------

The variable prefs(protocol) controls the "mode" of the whiteboard.
The two standard options are "jabber" and "symmetric", where symmetric
means peer-to-peer connections where all applications are both client and 
server.

There are two special modes "client" and "server" which is like
symmetric but where only a single connection is made from client
to server. There is no UI for this so it can only be hardcoded or
set from the command line. If set to any of these two modes, it
is necessary to edit the preference file to explicitly set the
mode back to symmetric or jabber mode.

The client mode only open client sockets, and the server mode only
has a listening (server) socket and never opens any client sockets.

This is how you launch setting the correct preferences and how to
automatically connect the client.

Server side:

wish Whiteboard.tcl -prefs_protocol server -prefs_thisServPort 8235

Client side:

wish Whiteboard.tcl -prefs_protocol client -prefs_remotePort 8235 \
	-connect 192.168.0.2

If you do it from wish do 'exec ... &'.
