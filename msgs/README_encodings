README for language encodings
-----------------------------

If you write your language specific message catalog saving it
using the system encodings, which is likely unless you have an
editor producing utf-8 text, you need to translate it using
the utf-8 encoding. If you don't you'll se a number of '?'
for your national characters.

Instructions:

1.   Copy the en.msg file to a file name describing your language code
and platform. Say, "fr.win" for French on Windows. As an alternative
you can take the Swedish message catalog, "sv.msg", as a template.

2.   Open it in your text editor. This file should be readable.
Now you edit it in your system encoding. Change all occurences of
"::msgcat::mcset en" to "::msgcat::mcset fr" if on a French system,
for instance. The syntax for each entry in a message catalog is:
::msgcat::mcset langCode key ?translatedString?
Add the 'translatedString' if missing, and do translate if exists.

3.  Utf-8 encode the file using the script below. Now you pick a file
name 'fr.msg' if French, for instance.

4.  In order to load the correct message catalog, you must set the
language code in the file 'Whiteboard.tcl' 
::msgcat::mclocale languageCode

Now try it...


Use the following code to do this:

........................................................................

# Translate a file from system encoding to utf-8

set src [tk_getOpenFile -title {Pick your language catalog}]
set new "[file rootname [file tail $src]].msg"
set fdsrc [open $src "r"]
set txt [read $fdsrc];
close $fdsrc
set dst [tk_getSaveFile -title {Pick new catalog}  \
	-initialdir [file dirname $src] -initialfile $new]
set fddst [open $dst "w"]
fconfigure $fddst -encoding utf-8
puts $fddst $txt
close $fddst
if {$::tcl_platform(platform) == "macintosh"} {
    set creator [file attributes $src -creator]
    file attributes $dst -creator $creator
}

........................................................................


# If you for some reason want to translate any of the message catalogs
# that are utf-8 encoded to your system enncoding do:

set src [tk_getOpenFile -title {Pick your utf-8 language catalog} \
	-filetypes {{{Message Catalogs}       {.msg}}}]
set suff [string range $::tcl_platform(platform) 0 2]
set new "[file rootname [file tail $src]].${suff}"
set fdsrc [open $src "r"]
fconfigure $fdsrc -encoding utf-8
set txt [read $fdsrc];
close $fdsrc
set dst [tk_getSaveFile -title {Save system encoded}  \
	-initialdir [file dirname $src] -initialfile $new]
set fddst [open $dst "w"]
puts $fddst $txt
close $fddst
if {$::tcl_platform(platform) == "macintosh"} {
    set creator [file attributes $src -creator]
    file attributes $dst -creator $creator
}
