README for components message catalogs
--------------------------------------

Each component, package or plugin can have its own message catalog in order 
to not pollute and create dependencies to the standard catalogs. These are 
placed within a folder in this directory. The folder will typically have the
same name as the component or plugin.

Layout:

    msgs/components/
                    MyPlug/
                           en.msg
                           es.msg
                           ...
                    OtherPlug/
                    ...


A package has normally its code in a specific namespace and you may define
some or all of your strings in this namespace as well in order to not
interfere with the main catalogs. This is particularly useful for short
strings which must be interpreted within the context they are used.

An example:


::msgcat::mcset  {This is one long string}  {Humbla kubla zapapy dustkop}

namespace eval ::MyPlug {
    ::msgcat::mc  File  Zkap
    ...
}

Don't know what language this is...
