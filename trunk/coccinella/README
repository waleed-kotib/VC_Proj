              The Coccinella : Whiteboard application in Tcl
              ----------------------------------------------

                    version 0.94.2, ??th ??????, 2002

                           by: Mats Bengtsson



    What is this?

	This is a whiteboard application that runs on the Internet.  It consists
	of a simple drawing and writing program where you share a canvas with 
	any other whiteboard.  This way you can share information between 
	friends.  Besides drawing and writing, it is possible to share files as
	well, such as images, movies, mp3's etc.

    The Jabber system:

        The whiteboard can be configured into two main modes.  The services
        supported by these two modes are very different.  You switch between 
	these two modes using the Preferences/Preferences...  menu, and the
        "General/Network Setup" panel.
    
	* Jabber Server: The Jabber Instant Messaging system is an XML based 
	  system that works similar to ICQ, AIM etc.  It delivers messages 
	  seamlessly between many instant messaging system and Jabber clients.  
	  This application is a Jabber client, but it is not a normal Jabber 
	  client since it delivers much more than just text messages.  Visit 
	  "www.jabber.org" for more information, and to obtain your own server.

	  To get started with a Jabber server, register an account (if you 
	  haven't already) using the Jabber/New Account...  menu, and fill in 
	  the fields.  When you later log on, you do it from the Jabber/Login...
	  menu, and pick the server you have an account at.

	* Peer-to-peer: This is the "raw" configuration, where users connect 
	  directly to each other, and not via an external server.  This mode 
	  does not deliver the kind of user administration that is supplied by 
	  the Jabber system, such as contact lists, online/offline, offline 
	  delivery etc. 

    Installation:

        * Obtain Tcl/Tk for your specific platform from "tcl.activestate.com".
	  This is for Windows and Unix/Linux.  Mac OS Classic get it from:
	  "http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tcl/MacTclTk_8.4.1_RuntimeInstl.bin?download"
	  Or if you want to try Mac OS X, look at: 
	  "http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tcl/TclTkAquaStandalone-8.4.1.dmg?download"

	* Obtain this whiteboard (if not already done that since you are reading
	  this) from http://hem.fyristorg.com/matben.  Its main directory may be
	  placed wherever you like on your disk.  

	It is necessary to have access to a unique server port on remote 
	machines, so it can be problematic if you are behind a firewall.  
	Firewalls are not dealt with at all at this stage.

    Running:

	Unix/Linux -- just write ./Whiteboard.tcl at the command line in the 
		same directory as 'Whiteboard.tcl'.  

	Windows -- either doubleclick Whiteboard.tcl or launch the wish 
		application and choose File/Source and pick "Whiteboard.tcl".  

	Mac -- launch the wish application and choose File/Source and pick
	       Whiteboard.tcl. You may need to select the Whiteboard* folder
	       as well due to a bug in Tcl/Tk.

    Testing:

	It is to be considered as a developer release, so beware.  *It is far 
	from being bug free*.  It has been developed and tested on MacOS 
	8.1-9.2, LinuxPPC R4, Red Hat Linux, Windows 98, and Windows 2000. 
	It requires a Tcl version 8.3 or later.

	I would judge this as an alpha quality application, not beta, which is 
	reflected in the version number ( < 1.0). No instabilities are known, 
	however.

    Additional Notes:
        
	* Macintosh: Use Tcl/Tk 8.3.4 or later.

	* Jabber: if you run this as a Jabber client, then be sure that the
	  servers's "karma", which controls maximal throughput, is set high.  
	  This client delivers more data than an ordinary Jabber client, and 
	  data may "get stuck" in the server if karma is too low.

	* Its name, Whiteboard, is generic and likely to change in the future,
	  possibly to "The Coccinella" (latin for ladybug).

    Documentation:

	The source code is the only documentation. At least so far ;-)
	See also the Info/Help menu.

    Packages (extra batteries):

	There are a number of binary, platform specific, packages for Mac,
	Windows, and Linux-x86. See the bin directory for a closer look of
	what's included. See also the Info/On Plugins... menu for more info.

    Non-latin character sets:

	On Macintosh with a "Chinese Language Kit" it is possible to write 
	chinese, at least does it look as chinese to me.  But you need to import
	the correct font from the Preference menu.  Be sure that all connected 
	remote clients also have this font on their system; I don't think it 
	needs to be imported. Probably any "Language Kit" should work.

    Known Bugs:

        * Althogh the server is using a safe interpreter for the critical parts
	  of canvas drawings which uses the dangerous eval, it probably does not 
	  cover all possible attacks from an evil client.

	* If large items are transported between clients, such as images, or
	  movies, operations on these items before they have been completely 
	  received by remote clients are lost.

        * Printer support is still in its infacy. You may export the canvas to
          XML/SVG format which can be imported into a web browser using the free
          plugin from www.adobe.com, and print from inside your browser.

        * There are numerous "details" that need to be fixed. After all, it is an 
          alpha quality software!

        As always, the code needs cleaning and restructuring.  If you want to see
        what is happening "inside" you may set the various debug variables equal to
        2 or larger.  There are two in Whiteboard.tcl, one in Jabber.tcl,
        jabberlib.tcl, and wrapper.tcl respectively. They may also be specified
        at the command line as:
        set argv "-debugLevel 3 -debugServerLevel 3 -jstate_debug 2"
        set argc 6
        and launch it.

    The Beetle:
