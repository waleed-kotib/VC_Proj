                            =============


This brief text describes the jabber features supported:

  * Ordinary messages, one-to-one chat, and groupchat.

  * Agent(s) method to discover services.

  * Browsing (jabber:iq:browse).

  * Groupchat is supported via the "old" 'groupchat 1.0' protocol,
    and via the never approved, but wide spread, jabber:iq:conference method.

  * File transfer using the oob method (http actually).

  * Handles forms using jabber:x:data

  * The Coccinella client can be browsed to, and returns the following
    namespace declarations describing its services:

      o jabber:client
      o jabber:iq:autoupdate
      o jabber:iq:browse
      o jabber:iq:conference
      o jabber:iq:last
      o jabber:iq:oob
      o jabber:iq:roster
      o jabber:iq:time
      o jabber:iq:version
      o jabber:x:autoupdate
      o jabber:x:data
      o coccinella:public
      o coccinella:wb
   

Note, however, that the jabber protocols outside the very core, are a moving 
target, and that changes and adoptions takes place at a rapid pace.
This is true for multi user conferencing in particular, where the MUC
protocol just has obtained Draft status. No native support for the MUC
protocol is provided in this release.
