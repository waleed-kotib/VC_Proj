This brief text describes the jabber features supported:

  * Ordinary messages, one-to-one chat, and groupchat.

  * Agent(s) method to discover services.

  * Browsing (jabber:iq:browse).

  * Groupchat is supported via the "old" 'groupchat 1.0' protocol,
    and via the never approved, but wide spread, jabber:iq:conference method.

  * File transfer using the oob method (http actually).

  * Handles forms using jabber:x:data

  * Supports the new MUC groupchat protocol

  * The Coccinella client can be browsed to, and returns the following
    namespace declarations describing its services:

      o jabber:client
      o jabber:iq:browse
      o jabber:iq:conference
      o jabber:iq:last
      o jabber:iq:oob
      o jabber:iq:roster
      o jabber:iq:time
      o jabber:iq:version
      o jabber:x:data
      o coccinella:public
      o coccinella:wb
   

Note, however, that the jabber protocols outside the very core, are a moving 
target, and that changes and adoptions takes place at a rapid pace.
