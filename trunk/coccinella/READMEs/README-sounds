To create a sound set.

There are two ways to do this:

1) Take your folder with sound files and put inside the 
Coccinella-*/sounds/ directory. This requires you run from
the sources, or that you are using Mac OS X and "open" the
application by control clicking it.

2) As an alternative you may put a sounds folder inside
the Coccinella's preference folder.
Typically you'll have a path .../Coccinella/sounds/MyNoises/

The content for both alternatives are identical:
In your sounds folder, create a file with name
'soundIndex.tcl' with a content that maps sound event names
to your actual file names. A typical content is:

set sound(online)         "Alarm.aif"
set sound(offline)        "Clunk.aif"
set sound(newmsg)         "eMate StartUp.aif"
set sound(newchatmsg)     "Frog.aif"
set sound(newchatthread)  "Metallic.aif"
set sound(statchange)     "Extras Close.aif"
set sound(connected)      "Extras Open.aif"
set sound(groupchatpres)  "Noise.aif"

This lists the presently available sound sets. Be sure to enclose
your file names in quotes if they contain spaces. Do use only
characters from the standard US ASCII set, and not language
dependent characters.

That's it!
