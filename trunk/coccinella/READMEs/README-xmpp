   o  XMPP URIs (RFC 4622)
   o  XMPP URI/IRI Querytypes from the Jabber Registrar


XMPP Extension Protocols (XEPs)
-------------------------------

The following XEPs are implemented, completely or in parts. Note that some of 
these XEPs have the form of a library or support protocol for other functions.
(These were formerly known as JEPs.)
