README for this directory structure (bin/*)

This is where all binaries go, that is, all packages
written in C code.

The directories at this level (macintosh, macosx, windows, unix)
correspond to the tcl variable 'tcl_platform(platform)' with
'macosx' as a special case.

On unix platforms (not Mac OS X) the following directory structure 
corresponds to the variable 'tcl_platform(os)'

The last directory corresponds to the 'tcl_platform(machine)' 
variable on all platforms.

Finally, all spaces are removed from the file path since not all
CVS systems like this.
