 README for bin/macosx/i386/

This is where all dylibs for the Intel Mac OS X go.
But we keep them Universal so that ppc can use them as well.
But we may limit the minimum MacOSX version.
Typically they are built with:

export CFLAGS="-arch ppc -arch i386 \
   -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -mmacosx-version-min=10.3"
