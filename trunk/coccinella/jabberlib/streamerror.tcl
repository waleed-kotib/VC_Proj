# The syntax for stream errors is as follows:
#
#   <stream:error>
#      <defined-condition xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-streams'/>
#      <text xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-streams'>
#        OPTIONAL descriptive text
#      </text>
#      [OPTIONAL application-specific condition element]
#   </stream:error>

	   that is unsupported, or has sent no namespace prefix on an element\
	   that requires such a prefix.}

	   entity because a new stream has been initiated that conflicts with\
	   the existing stream.}

	   over the stream for some period of time.}

	   that is no longer hosted by the server.}

	   hostname that is hosted by the server.}

	internal-server-error {the server has experienced a\
	   misconfiguration or an otherwise-undefined internal error that\

	   address does not match an authorized JID or validated domain\
	   negotiated between servers via SASL or dialback, or between a\
	   client and a server via authentication and resource binding.}

	   not match an ID previously provided.}
	invalid-namespace     {the streams namespace name is something\
	   other than "http://etherx.jabber.org/streams" or the dialback\
	   namespace name is something other than "jabber:server:dialback".}

	   to a server that performs validation.}
	not-authorized        {the entity has attempted to send data before\
	   the stream has been authenticated, or otherwise is not authorized\
	   to perform an action related to stream negotiation; the receiving\
	   entity MUST NOT process the offending stanza before sending the\
	   stream error.}
	policy-violation      {the entity has violated some local service\
	   policy; the server MAY choose to specify the policy in the <text/>\
	   element or an application-specific condition element.}
	remote-connection-failed {the server is unable to properly\
	   connect to a remote entity that is required for authentication or\
	   authorization.}
	resource-constraint   {the server lacks the system resources\
	   necessary to service the stream.}
	restricted-xml        {the entity has attempted to send restricted\
	   XML features such as a comment, processing instruction, DTD,\
	   entity reference, or unescaped character.}
	see-other-host        {the server will not provide service to the\
	   initiating entity but is redirecting traffic to another host; the\
	   server SHOULD specify the alternate hostname or IP address (which\
	   MUST be a valid domain identifier) as the XML character data of\
	   the <see-other-host/> element.}
	system-shutdown       {the server is being shut down and all active\
	   streams are being closed.}
	undefined-condition {the error condition is not one of those\
	   defined by the other conditions in this list; this error condition\
	   SHOULD be used only in conjunction with an application-specific\
	   condition.}
	unsupported-encoding  {the initiating entity has encoded the\
	   stream in an encoding that is not supported by the server.}
	unsupported-stanza-type {the initiating entity has sent a\
	   first-level child of the stream that is not supported by the\
	   server.}
	unsupported-version   {the value of the 'version' attribute\
	   provided by the initiating entity in the stream header specifies a\
	   version of XMPP that is not supported by the server.}
	xml-not-well-formed   {the initiating entity has sent XML that\
	   is not well-formed as defined by [XML].}
