README-plugins

There are two types of registration mechanisms for external code:
plugins and components.

A plugin imports documents, or some representation of it like an
icon, with specific mime type into a whiteboard.
This is where plugins should go. Only experimental so far.
See Example.tcl for an example.

A component is a general code fragment that can supply any functionality
to the application. Examples are synthetic speech, screenshots etc.
