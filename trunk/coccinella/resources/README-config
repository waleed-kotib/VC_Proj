README-config

There are several layers of customization.
At the top there are the user prefs saved to the preference file.
And then there are resources stored in the resource database. 
See README-resources. These are mainly for setting things associated with
the widgets, fonts and such.

At the bottom there are hardcoded options stored in the global 'config'
array. These defaults are set within in each package that uses them.
They can be overriden by any resources/config.tcl file. Normally there
is no such file, but it can be put there at build time. This allows for
custom builds that change "lower-level" details of how the application
works and looks.

The resources/configExample.tcl is an example config file that shows
some of the possible customization.
