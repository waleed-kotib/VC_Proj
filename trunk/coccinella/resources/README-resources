Most of the apperance of widgets, such as colors and fonts, is set
via the built in option database for resources.

The default.rdb file always sets some reasonable values.
After that the platform specific rdb file is read.
If the theme is set in the prefs file, the themeName.rdb
file is read.

There are several levels of options that can be set.

1) Tk's standard widget resources are set the usual way.
Examples:
*background:	      #aea485
*Button.background:   red

2) Specific megawidget resources are set using, for instance:
*Tablelist.background:             #aa2222

3) There are several application specific classes that can be
used when specifying resources. They are:
Whiteboard, JMain, MailBox, Chat, GroupChat, NewMsg, Splash.
Use them as:
*MailBox*Tablelist.labelBackground:        #dd1111

4) Some of these also have specific resource names, see the
respective sources for this. One example:
*Chat*youBackground:        green

5) Most icons may also be customized. Place your gif images
in their own directory inside the images/ directory of the
sources. Give this directory a name that associates to the 
theme name. Specify this directory in your themes rdb file as:
*themeImageDir:                     galileolinux

6) Each image has a resource name associated with it. If you keep
the filename the same as in the original distro, the image
will be automatically used. You may also pick a different
name, but then you must specify a new value for the resource
that is also the file name. Examplevise:
*JMain.connectImage       imageMyConnect

where the 'imageMyConnect.gif' file is inside the themes image directory.

7) It is extremely important that the name you pick is a unique
name, not only for images, but also for all tcl procs since an image
name is also the name of a tcl procedure. Therefore prefix all
names with, say 'image'. 

8) Some widgets...

9) Images are searched for in this order:
   o the images/themeImageDir, in this case images/galileolinux
   o then images/platformName where the platformName is any of
     unix, windows, macintosh, or macosx
   o lastly, in images/

Some images have also been hardcoded into the sources, and they
will be obtained from there if not found in the above directory
hierarchy.

That's it!
