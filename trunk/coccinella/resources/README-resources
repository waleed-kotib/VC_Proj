There are two kinds of options that are set using resources:

 o Widget options look for values in the resource data base unless
   they have been hardcoded in the application sources.

 o There are application specific resources that control the more
   "high level" parts of the user interface.

The default.rdb file always sets some reasonable values.
After that the platform specific rdb file is read. Typical name is macosx.rdb.
If a specific application theme is set, resources are also searched for
in its resource folder. An example:

    themes/Cool/resources/default.rdb

using the same rules, first default, then platform specific.

Widget specific options can be specified in several more or less generic ways.
See the Tk and tile docs for complete descriptions. Below are listed the levels
of resources that can be specified:

1) Tk's  and tile standard widget resources:

*Canvas.background:  #dedede

2) Specific megawidget resources are set using, for instance:

*Tablelist.background:  #aa2222

3) There are several application specific classes that can be
used when specifying resources. They are:
Whiteboard, JMain, MailBox, Chat, GroupChat, NewMsg, Splash... 
Search the sources.

*MailBox*Tablelist.labelBackground:  #dd1111

4) Some of these also have specific resource names, see the
respective sources for this. One example:

*Chat*youPreBackground:  green

5) Each image has a resource name associated with it. If you keep
the filename the same as in the original distro, the image
will be automatically used. You may also pick a different
name, but then you must specify a new value for the resource
that is also the file name. Examplevise:

*JMain.connectImage:  imageMyConnect
