Most icons are made by the Oxygen Team (KDE): http://www.kde.org/

Some icons are created by Sander Devrieze and may be based on existing Oxygen icons: draw-arrow, inbox-unread, mail-quote, notify-typig, user-chat

hi icons from Kolourpaint (draw-oval, draw-rect, draw-line, draw-poly) are made by Nuno Pinheiro and Danny Allen.

draw-arc is stolen from Gimp and slightly changed (Thank You!).

mood-* icons, activity-* icons, *tlen* icons and maybe a few others are from the Gajim project: http://gajim.org/

A few icons and other graphics elements may come from the Crystal icon set
by Everaldo and are Copyrighted. They are used in The Coccinella by a
granted permission, see below. I'm most grateful for their permission
to use these amzing icons. Many Thanks!
