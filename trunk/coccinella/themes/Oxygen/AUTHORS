Coccinella's Oxygen Icon Theme

Most icons were taken from KDE revision 933217 of the Oxygen Icon Theme created by The Oxygen Team (credits at the bottom).

Icons created by Sander Devrieze (some are based on original Oxygen Icon Theme icons): draw-arrow, inbox-unread, mail-quote, notify-typing, user-chat.
Icons created by Nuno Pinheiro and Danny Allen (hicolor icon set of Kolourpaint): draw-oval, draw-rect, draw-line, draw-poly.
draw-arc, colorSelSwap and colorSelBW are stolen from Gimp and slightly changed (Thank You!).
mood-* icons, activity-* icons, *tlen* icons and maybe a few others are from the Gajim project: http://gajim.org/

All icons are (re)licensed as GPLv3
